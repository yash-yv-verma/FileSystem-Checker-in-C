# File System Checker in C

The File System Checker is a tool designed to verify the integrity and security of files within a directory. It checks for discrepancies in file permissions and verifies file contents using checksum validation. This tool is particularly useful for ensuring that files have not been tampered with and that they maintain the expected permissions and data integrity.
